   <h2>Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food?</h2>
  <div class="messagebox shadow" id="Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food?">
    <ul>
<li>There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.</li>
      <br>
<li>The risk of getting sick with COVID-19 from eating or handling food (including frozen food and produce) and food packages is considered very low.</li>
      <br>
<li>The risk of getting COVID-19 from food you cook yourself or from handling and consuming food from restaurants and takeout or drive-thru meals is thought to be very low. Currently, there is no evidence that food is associated with spreading the virus that causes COVID-19

<h2>Do most people who get COVID-19 recover?</h2>

    <ul>
<li>FACT: Most people who get COVID-19 recover from it

Most people who get COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms and can recover thanks to supportive care. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early - call your health facility by telephone first. If you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue seek medical care immediately</li>
      <br>
<li>disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, will have only mild illness. But what exactly does that mean?

Mild COVID-19 cases still can make you feel lousy. But you should be able to rest at home and recover fully without a trip to the hospital. Here’s what to expect and how to take care of yourself.</li>

<h2>Are small gatherings safe during COVID-19 pandemic?</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="Are small gatherings safe during COVID-19 pandemic?">
        
        <li>Any decision to hold an event during the COVID-19 pandemic, no matter how large or small, should rely on a risk-based approach. WHO has provided guidance on how such a risk-based approach can be taken. This Q&A is focused on small, non-professional gatherings and events (i.e. birthday parties, children’s football games, family occasions). Precautions to consider include actions to prevent transmission between people, and where to hold the venue and how it can be modified to make a safer environment. Cancelling a planned event is an option that should always be considered, especially in case of non-essential events or when precautions cannot be implemented or adequately communicated.</li>
        <p> What precautions should I take to protect myself and others from getting infected with COVID-19? </p>
        <li>Always check local regulations before attending an event</li>
        <li>Stay at home if you are feeling unwell.</li>
        <li>Always comply with the following 3 basic preventive measures:</li>

<h2>Can COVID-19 be transmitted through feces or urine?</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="Can COVID-19 be transmitted through feces or urine?">
        <ul>
       
<li>SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other biological samples, including the urine and feces of some patients. One study found viable SARS-CoV-2 in the urine of one patient. Three studies have cultured SARS-CoV-2 from stool specimens. To date, however, there have been no published reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine.</li>
<li>The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces has led to speculation that it can be transmitted via the fecal-oral/ocular route. This review aims to critically evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the quantity and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine, and whether these pose an infection risk in sanitary settings, sewage networks, wastewater treatment plants, and the wider environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and marine waters). A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3% exhibiting vomiting and nausea.</li>
